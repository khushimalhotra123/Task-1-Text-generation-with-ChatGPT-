Introduction

Generative AI, particularly in the realm of natural language processing (NLP), has shown remarkable advancements with models like GPT-2. This project is a hands-on exploration of GPT-2’s capabilities in generating human-like text. The primary focus is on understanding the model’s architecture, fine-tuning it for specific tasks, and evaluating its performance.

This task is a part of the internship at Prodigy InfoTech, where I, as a Generative AI intern, explored the practical applications of GPT-2 in real-world scenarios. The project encapsulates the following objectives:

	•	Fine-tuning GPT-2 for specific text generation tasks.
	•	Evaluating the quality and coherence of generated text.
	•	Documenting the process, challenges, and insights gained.

Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-generation-gpt2.git
cd text-generation-gpt2


	2.	Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


	3.	Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	4.	Download GPT-2 model weights:
You can download the pre-trained GPT-2 weights using Hugging Face’s transformers library:

python -c "from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel; GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')"



Usage

Data Preparation

	1.	Data Collection: Place your raw text data in the data/raw/ directory.
	2.	Data Preprocessing: Use the 01_data_preparation.ipynb notebook to clean and preprocess the data. The processed data will be stored in data/processed/.

Model Training

	1.	Fine-tune GPT-2: Use the train.py script or the 02_model_training.ipynb notebook to fine-tune GPT-2 on your dataset.

python scripts/train.py --data_dir data/processed/ --model_output_dir models/gpt2_fine_tuned/


	2.	Monitor Training: Use TensorBoard or similar tools to monitor training progress.

Text Generation

	1.	Generate Text: Use the generate.py script or the 03_text_generation.ipynb notebook to generate text using the fine-tuned model.

python scripts/generate.py --model_dir models/gpt2_fine_tuned/ --output_dir results/generated_texts/


	2.	Evaluate Output: Review the generated texts in results/generated_texts/ and analyze their quality.

Experiments and Results

This section should document the experiments conducted during the project. It includes:

	•	Hyperparameter Tuning: A summary of different hyperparameters tried and their impact on model performance.
	•	Sample Outputs: Examples of text generated by the fine-tuned GPT-2 model.
	•	Evaluation Metrics: A discussion on the metrics used to evaluate text quality, such as perplexity, coherence, diversity, etc.

Challenges and Learnings

Throughout this project, several challenges were encountered, including:

	•	Data Quality: Handling noisy or unstructured text data.
	•	Model Fine-tuning: Balancing the model’s tendency to overfit on small datasets while ensuring it captures the desired output style.
	•	Computational Resources: Managing the resource-intensive process of fine-tuning large language models like GPT-2.

Key learnings include:

	•	The importance of a well-curated dataset in achieving high-quality text generation.
	•	Understanding the trade-offs between model size, training time, and output quality.
