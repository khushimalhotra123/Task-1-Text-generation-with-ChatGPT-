# Text-generation-with-GPT-2
This repository contains code and resources for generating text using OpenAI's GPT-2 model. GPT-2 is a large transformer-based language model capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gpt2-text-generation.git
    cd gpt2-text-generation
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    The `requirements.txt` file includes essential libraries such as `transformers`, `torch`, and others necessary for running GPT-2.

## Usage

To generate text using GPT-2, you can run the `generate_text.py` script. This script takes a prompt as input and generates text based on it.

### Example Command:

```bash
python generate_text.py --prompt "Once upon a time" --max_length 50 --temperature 0.7
```

### Arguments:

- `--prompt`: The initial text to start the generation.
- `--max_length`: The maximum length of the generated text.
- `--temperature`: Controls the randomness of predictions by scaling the logits before applying softmax.

## Examples

Here are some examples of text generated using this repository:

- **Prompt:** "In the future, AI will"
  
  **Generated Text:** "In the future, AI will revolutionize industries, from healthcare to finance. Autonomous systems will..."

- **Prompt:** "The secrets of the universe lie"
  
  **Generated Text:** "The secrets of the universe lie within the fabric of spacetime. Scientists have long debated whether..."

## Training

This repository also includes scripts for training and fine-tuning GPT-2 on your own datasets. 

### Fine-Tuning on Custom Data:

To fine-tune GPT-2 on custom data, place your text data in the `data/` directory and use the `train.py` script:

```bash
python train.py --data_path ./data/my_dataset.txt --epochs 3 --batch_size 2
```

### Arguments:

- `--data_path`: Path to the text file used for training.
- `--epochs`: Number of training epochs.
- `--batch_size`: Batch size for training.

## Model Fine-Tuning

If you'd like to fine-tune GPT-2 on a specific domain or set of texts, you can use the `fine_tune.py` script:

```bash
python fine_tune.py --dataset_path ./data/my_dataset.txt --model_save_path ./models/custom_gpt2
```

This will allow you to save a custom fine-tuned GPT-2 model that you can later use for more specific text generation tasks.
